Hi, I'm Polly!  

I am currently working as a postdoctoral research fellow in applied mathematics at the University of Leeds. My research is in collaboration with the defense science and technologies laboratory (DSTL), and I am building a within-host multi-scale mathematical model of Anthrax infection. I am part of the [group of mathematical biology and medicine](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/school/research/mathbiomed/) and prior to starting my postdoc, completed my PhD within the same group, collaborating with AstraZeneca. I have a first class degree in Mathematics during which I spent a year out working in industry for Lapcorp drug development as a biostatistician.  

Please follow the links on this site to see more about my past and current research projects, outreach involvement, publications and conferences. There is also a link to my current CV/resume and I will be looking for a new position from the summer of 2022.  

I am interested in mathematical modelling, statistical learning and data science within the context of health and disease. I have experience in all of these areas including programming (predominantly in Python), Bayesian and frequentist statistics, data visualisation and scientific writing. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, travelling, hiking and I am an active member of a triathlon club! Below is a photo from my undergraduate graduation ceremony.
