Throughout my PhD studies at Leeds I was involved in several outreach projects and activities:

Organising and leading small group projects at a sixth form college, combining biology, mathematics and computer programming.  
2. "Medicine, not just about medics", December 2018 - 2019  
Delivering interactive mathematical biology sessions to year 10 and 11 students.  
3. Leeds festival of science, March 2019  
Delivering interactive mathematical biology sessions to classes of school children in years 7 to 11.
