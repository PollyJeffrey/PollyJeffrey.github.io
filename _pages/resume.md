### Relevant experience  
<span style="color:#47689e">Postdoctoral research fellow in Applied Mathematics</span>, 2021 - Present  
*University of Leeds*  
My research is in collaboration with the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL). I am using computational mathematical modelling and data analysis to study the within-host spread of Anthrax infection. The model will be able to make predictions about the spread and severity of Anthrax infection, and will incorporate different drug treatments.

<span style="color:#47689e">Tutor in Applied Mathematics</span>, 2019 - 2020  
*University of Leeds*  
Throughout my PhD I tutored small groups of undergraduate students in applied mathematics and statistics. This role also involved giving feedback for regular assignments.

<span style="color:#47689e">Biostatistician</span>, 2015 - 2016  
*Labcorp drug development*  
I spent a year out from my undergraduate degree working for Labcorp as a student biostatistician. This role involved programming using the language SAS, to generate tables, figures and listings, as well as performing statistical analysis with clinical data and writing statistical documents. I was also involved with the training of new starters towards the end of my placement.
