## Relevant experience  
**Postdoctoral research fellow in Applied Mathematics**, 2021 - Present  
University of Leeds  
My research is in collaboration with the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL). I am using computational mathematical modelling and data analysis to study the within-host spread of Anthrax infection. The model will be able to make predictions about the spread and severity of Anthrax infection, and will incorporate different drug treatments.

**Tutor in Applied Mathematics**, 2019 - 2020  
University of Leeds  
Throughout my PhD I tutored small groups of undergraduate students in applied mathematics and statistics. This role also involved giving feedback for regular assignments.

**Biostatistician**, 2015 - 2016  
Labcorp drug development  
I spent a year out from my undergraduate degree working for Labcorp as a student biostatistician. This role involved programming using the language SAS, to generate tables, figures and listings, as well as performing statistical analysis with clinical data and writing statistical documents. I was also involved with the training of new starters towards the end of my placement.
