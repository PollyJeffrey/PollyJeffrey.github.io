### Relevant experience  
Postdoctoral research fellow in Applied Mathematics, 2021 - Present  
*University of Leeds*  
My research is in collaboration with the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL). I am using computational mathematical modelling and data analysis to study the within-host spread of Anthrax infection. The model will be able to make predictions about the spread and severity of Anthrax infection, and will incorporate different drug treatments.

Tutor in Applied Mathematics, 2019 - 2020  
*University of Leeds*  
Throughout my PhD I tutored small groups of undergraduate students in applied mathematics and statistics. This role also involved giving feedback for regular assignments.

Biostatistician, 2015 - 2016  
*Labcorp drug development*  
I spent a year out from my undergraduate degree working for Labcorp as a student biostatistician. This role involved programming using the language SAS, to generate tables, figures and listings, as well as performing statistical analysis with clinical data and writing statistical documents. I was also involved with the training of new starters towards the end of my placement.
