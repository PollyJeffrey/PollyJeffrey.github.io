### Postdoc research project
For my current postdoc I am working with DSTL, combining mathematical modelling with data to study the within-host spread of Anthrax infection. *Bacillus anthracis* is a bacterium that can survive as a dormant spore for years, and upon inhalation by a host, can de-sporulate and cause deadly disease. If caught early, treatment is possible with a long course of antibiotics. I am using stochastic and deterministic modelling to describe the intracellular and within-host dynamics of Anthrax infection, working with dose response and time course data from DSTL to calibrate such models. The aim is to use these models to make predictions about infection and survival in patients with Anthrax, and to quantify the effects of different antibiotic treatments.

### PhD research projects
PhD thesis title: Mathematical modelling of cellular receptor-ligand dynamics

1. <span style="color:#47689e">A stochastic model of receptor-ligand competition dynamics</span>  
This project explored the competition between two receptor types for a common ligand using a two-dimensional Markov chain model. I firstly used matrix-analytic methods to analyse the steady state distribution and timescales of receptor-ligand complex formation, in the model. Due to the computational expense of such methods, I then developed novel approximate methods to analyse the same properties of the model, making use of well known results from one-dimensional birth-and-death Markov processes. The two approaches were compared numerically and all methods were run using Python.
2. <span style="color:#47689e">Mathematical modelling of cytokine receptor signalling</span>  
This project was in collaboration with scientists from the school of life sciences at the University of Dundee. They were interested in exploring JAK/STAT pathway signalling upon stimulation of cells with two different cytokines, IL-6 and IL-27. We developoed deterministic mathematical models for the experimental systems and calibrated such models using Bayesian inference. Along with Bayesian model selection, this allowed us to answer questions about the cause of differences seen in the STAT signalling profiles under the different cytokine stimulants.
3. <span style="color:#47689e">Mathematical modelling of FGFR2 ternary complex formation</span>  
This project was in collaboration with scientists from the group of molecular and cellular biology at the University of Leeds. We used a deterministic mathematical model to simulate the formation of a ternary complex of the molecules FGFR2, Plcy and Shp2, seen experimentally. The model was able to validate the existence of such a ternary complex. I then used steady state and stability analysis to determine regions of the realistic parameter (e.g. binding rate constant) space for which the steady state involving the ternary complex was stable. 
4. <span style="color:#47689e">Statistical analysis of EGFR inhibition</span>  
This project was in collaboration with oncology scientists from AstraZeneca, my industrial partner for the PhD. I carried out statistical analysis using a large dataset containing dose response and time course data relating to signalling of proteins in the MAPK pathway upon treatment with different EGFR inhibitors, where EGFR is a receptor molecule often at the head of the MAPK pathway. I used ANOVA and post-hoc analyses as well as principal component analysis to examine trends in the data and elucidate specific inhibitors which were more effective than others.
