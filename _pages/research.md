Thesis working title:  
*"Mathematical modelling of cellular receptor signalling"*

I am interested in using deterministic and stochastic mathematical models to answer questions about biological systems, in particular systems involving the interaction between cell surface receptors and other extra- and intra-cellular molecules. I am also interested in learning about the parameters, such as binding rate constants, of such mathematical models by employing Bayesian inference techniques.

Although my current research focuses around molecular interactions, I am also interested in using mathematical modelling to study the spread of disease, within host and within a population. Viral and bacterial modelling is a focus of the research group as a whole which I am currently a member of.
			
As well as mathematical modelling and statistical inference, I enjoy programming and have experience both Python, R, Mathematica and Matlab.
